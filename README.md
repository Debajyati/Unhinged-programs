# Unhinged-programs
a collection of quirky, unusual, or even esoteric programs written in various **Non-Esoteric** programming languages.

## What's Here?
This repository is for those who enjoy a bit of programming whimsy and want to see how different languages can be used in unexpected ways. Whether the programs are truly useful or not takes a back seat to their creativity and exploration of the language's capabilities and their playful mind.

These programs may not necessarily be practical or solve real-world problems, but they explore the boundaries of what's possible and can be a fun way to experiment with different programming concepts.

This repository is organized by programming language, with each language having its own dedicated folder.

## What to Expect?

- Collection of playful and sometimes nonsensical programs from diverse **Non-Esoteric** programming languages,
- Code that may be really clever, bizarre, or silly.
- A healthy dose of amusement (hopefully!).

## Contributing
We welcome contributions of new and interesting programs to this repository.

Some guidelines for contributing:-

- Make sure your program is written in a language that is already represented in the repository. If you want to add a program in a new language, please create a new folder for that language.
- Your program should be well-documented, with short comments explaining what it does and how it works.
- If your program is particularly complex, you have to make a folder of your program file and include a README file in the program's folder that explains how to use it.
- No AI generated programs. If your code comments seem like they are AI generated, your PR won't be merged.
- Be creative, and may also be little playful.
- Programs should be able to run.
- No **Esoteric** languages (brainfuck, malabolge, etc.) will be permitted.
